\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:org048c89c}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Faith and Vocation as Practitioners of Engineering, Computer Science, and
 Technology}
\end{center}

\emph{``Whether you are a student or a seasoned professional, many Christians working
in technical areas struggle with engaging their faith in the world of
technology. Perhaps you never thought about how your faith might inform your
work in technology. Perhaps you feel a disconnect between your daily
professional life and your Christian spiritual walk. The development of
technology through science and engineering has always been a cultural activity
with religious implications, but its direction is set by the human heart.
Developing and using technology is one way we love God and our neighbor, and
more fully witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ for the entire world.''}
\begin{flushright}
From \emph{A Christian Field Guide to Technology for Engineers and Designers} by
Ethan Brue, Derek Schuurman, and Steven Vanderleest
\end{flushright}

The primary question driving this discussion group is, \emph{What is the role of a
Christian in a technological vocation?} Modernity seems to be telling us that
science, technology, and engineering are somehow opposed to faith. Furthermore,
to many, the influence of technology and ``science'' are the primary reasons for
abandoning their faith. However, many feel called to engage with technology, not
simply as an end user, but a creator, practitioner, designer, and engineer.

\subsection*{Week 1}
\label{sec:orgc6d957e}
\textbf{\uline{Subject: The Technological Frame}}

\emph{“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice
is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the
streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not
fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these
words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who
built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds
blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”} Matthew
7:24-27

Can we build our understanding of the technological vocation on rock?
